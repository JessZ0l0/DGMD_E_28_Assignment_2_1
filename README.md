## Answer to question:  Identify an area of CSS code you feel really good about â€“ and indicate why.
- I feel most confident in my ability to research can implement CSS styling solutions to achieve the desired appearance for an element. Through extensive practical trial and error, I have developed a proficient understanding of CSS properties such as flexbox, grid, and animations. While I recognize there is always room for improvement, I genuinely enjoy the design process and refining styles to create intuitive and aesthetically pleasing web interfaces.
